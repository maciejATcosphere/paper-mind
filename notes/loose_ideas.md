Teaching:
- Start teaching coding by simply encoding in humourous way some sample code (what can you see? words, pharses, letter, different colours). Let students explore those concept so that they could enforce themselves that there is nothing mysterious behind coding
- After discovering syntax they one can enforce the idea of interpreter! As translatring the code pharses (sentences) into actions!
- Integrate Quizlet into teaching platform
- Integrate MindMeister into teaching platform
- Revive real-time slide presenter for reveal.js

Pandas:
- Add pandas dataframe display presenting example rows, counts etc.
- Overwrite pandas plot to generate js interactive plots when used in notebook
- Actions on plot could be translated to the masks (pandas macro generator)
- Integrate notebooks with mindmap

Notebook:
- X already covered by newest ipython (soon) -> Add transformation to the presentation for the notebook (runable cells from presentation)
- Add multiple cursor functionality to the codemirror notebook cell
- Introduce D3.js charts and make them sharable with others in the company. Allow others putting comments on
the chart directly (one can get access to data and context to where used to produce a given visualization)

Sales:
- Create set of ipython notebooks that could be presented during pitches
